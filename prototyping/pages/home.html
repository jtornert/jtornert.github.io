        This site showcases the prototyping capabilities with htmx and
        Alpine.js.

    <h2 data-font-size="large3">Benefits</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            With htmx, you can quickly simulate responses from web servers and
            hypermedia APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
            With Alpine.js, you can easily add trivial UI behaviour contained in
            both the initially loaded site as well as the API hypermedia loaded
            with htmx.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Have a look around. <b>No navigation will occur.</b> Refreshing will
        reset everything and take you back to this page.
